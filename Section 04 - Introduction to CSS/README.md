# Introduction to CSS
* CSS stands for Cascade Styling Sheet

## 01) How and Why to use
* CSS is used when we want to give a style to a particular element inside our HTML file.
* We can use it in several way: We can use it embedded inside a HTML tag, we can use it inside a ```<style></style>``` tag that exists inside the ```<head></head>``` tag or we can use it inside a separate file that we usually call "style.css".

## 02) Example of styling the whole body of a HTML file.
```html
...
<head>
  <meta>
  <title> Example 1 </title>
  <style> <!-- These lines of code are responsible for changing the whole background color of our webiste. -->
    body {
      background-color: powderblue; 
    }
  </style>
</head>

...
```
