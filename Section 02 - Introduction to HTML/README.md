# Section 02 - Introduction to HTML
* Code snippets and Notes about this section stay here.

## 01) About headings tags < h > < /h >
* The heading tags go through: h1 to h6.
* When the number is growing, the size of the heading is getting smaller.

## 02) About HTML tags, HTML elements and HTML attributes
* Consider the case below:
```html
<hr size="3">
--- All this structure above is called a HTML tag
--- hr is a HTML element
--- size="3" is a HTML attribute
```
## 03) The < br > tag
* This tag is used to do a line break inside our HTML document.

## 04) The < hr > tag
* This tag is used to draw a horizontal line inside our HTML file.
* It has several attributes such as: color, size, noshade and others. For more info, check out www.devdocs.io

## 05) Comments 
* The way to do a comment in HTML is:
```
<!-- This is a comment, my friends! -->
```

## 06) The < title > tag
* This specific tag is used to display the title of our webpage inside a tab of the browser that we are using.
* This tag must be inside the < head > < /head > tag.

## 07) The < head > and the < body > tag
* The head tag indicates to the browser how it should interpret the HTML file that it's reading.
* The body tag is where the content of our webpage really stays.

## 08) The emphasis < em > tag vs The < i > italic tag
* The emphasis tag is used when we want to "say" to the browser that this specific part of the text is important and, because of that, it should be displayed in italic.
* The italic tag just tells to the browser that this specific part of the text must be displayed in italic but it does not "explain" why.
* It is preferred to always use the emphasis tag instead of the italic tag.

## 09) The < strong > strong tag vs the < b > bold tag
* The strong tag also "says" to the browser that this specific part of the text is important and therefore should be displayed in a bold way.
* The bold tag just "tells" the browser to display this part of the text in a bold way.
* One should always use the strong tag instead of the bold tag.

## 10) The < ul > tag
* This type of HTML tag is used to construct an unordered list.
* Unordered lists are also called bullet list, since each element of this type of list is represented using a bullet.
* The elements of an unordered list must be contained inside a: < li >< /li > tag.

## 11) The < ol > tag
* This type of tag is used to represent an ordered list in HTML.
* We can use the atribute "type" to enumerate the elements of the list using roman numerals instead of common integers.
* The elements that belong to an ordered list must be insde a < li >< /li > tag.
