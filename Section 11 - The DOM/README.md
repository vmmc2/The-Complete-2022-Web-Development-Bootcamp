# The DOM (Document Object Model)

## Inserting JavaScript into a Website
* We can use javascript in our website through different ways: we can use it in a embedded way in the HTML file, we can use it in an internal way also inside the HTML file and we can use it in an external way in a separate .js file.
  * Embedded: We put our javascript code inside double quotes ```""``` as a value for an HTML attribute called ```onload```.
