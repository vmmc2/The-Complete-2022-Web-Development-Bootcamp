* Now, we are going to learn a few commands from UNIX Command Line to help us interact with the kernel.

## ```ls``` or ```ls -a```
* This command is used to list all the files and directories/folders that are present inside the current directory/folder.

## ```cd nameOfDirectory```
* This command is used to change the directory that we are currently in to another directory that is inside the current directory.
* We can navigate from our directory to another specific directory by providing the complete path.
* If we want to go back one level in the directory root, then we should use the following command: ```cd ..```.
