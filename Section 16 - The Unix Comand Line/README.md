# The UNIX Comand Line
* UNIX like operating systems are commonly used in different operating systems like: Linux and MacOS.
* Now, we are going to learn a few commands from UNIX Command Line to help us interact with the kernel.

## ```ls``` or ```ls -a```
* This command is used to list all the files and directories/folders that are present inside the current directory/folder.

## ```cd nameOfDirectory```
* This command is used to change the directory that we are currently in to another directory that is inside the current directory.
* We can navigate from our directory to another specific directory by providing the complete path.
* If we want to go back one level in the directory root, then we should use the following command: ```cd ..```.

## ```mkdir nameOfDirectory```
* This command is used to create a new directory of name "nameOfDirectory".

## ```pwd```
* This command is also known as "print working directory".
* It's used to specify the current directory that we are currently in.

## ```rm nameOfFile```
* This command is used to delete a specific __file__ that is inside the current directory.
* To delete __all files__ that are inside the currrent folder, we put: ```rm *```.
* __It's possible to also delete a folder. For that, we must use a specific command ```rm -r nameOfFolder```. This command is going to delete this specific folder and all of its children components (files and subfolders).__
