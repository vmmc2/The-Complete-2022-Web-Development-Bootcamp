# Section 22 - EJS

### Intro
* EJS stands for Embedded JavaScript. It's a npm package that, once installed, allows us to create template files in order to display the server logic (in HTML files) to the browser.
* In order to install EJS on your project, you must open your terminal in your project's folder and run the following command:
```
npm install ejs
```
